Network Architecture
It consists of a contracting path (left side) and an expansive path (right side). The contracting path follows the typical architecture of a convolutional network. It consists of the repeated application of two 3x3 convolutions (unpadded convolutions), each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a 2x2 max pooling operation with stride 2
for downsampling. At each downsampling step we double the number of feature channels. Every step in the expansive path consists of an upsampling of thefeature map followed by a 2x2 convolution (“up-convolution”) that halves the number of feature channels, a concatenation with the correspondingly cropped feature map from the contracting path, and two 3x3 convolutions, each followed by a ReLU. The cropping is necessary due to the loss of border pixels in every convolution. At the final layer a 1x1 convolution is used to map each 64-component feature vector to the desired number of classes. In total the network has 23 convolutional layers.To allow a seamless tiling of the output segmentation map, it is important to select the input tile size such that all 2x2 max-pooling operations are applied to a layer with an even x- and y-size.
